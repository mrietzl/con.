# con. â€“ a social network project

This project is a meeting platform for designer and web developer. People can create their own account, login or logout and edit their profile by uploading a picture or editing the bio. They can also delete their profile again or set a new password. Additionally other profiles can be viewed, users can search for friends send friendship requests to each other or chat together. The social network has its own branding with a logo, a color scheme and the possibility to change between two color modi by a toggle bar. The logo within the tab bar adapts to the respective light/dark mode of the browser.

The project was made at the [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/de) within my Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp (Nov. '21 to Feb. '22)
